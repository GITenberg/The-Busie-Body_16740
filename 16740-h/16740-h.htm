<p class = "intro">
Susanna Centlivre (1667?-1723) in <i>The Busie Body</i> (1709)
contributed to the stage one of the most successful comedies of intrigue
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This play, written when
there was a decided trend in England toward sentimental drama, shows
Mrs. Centlivre a strong supporter of laughing comedy. She had turned for
a time to sentimental comedy and with one of her three sentimental
plays, <i>The Gamester</i> (1704), had achieved a great success. But her
true bent seems to have been toward realistic comedies, chiefly of
intrigue: of her nineteen plays written from 1700 to 1723, ten are
realistic comedies. Three of these proved very popular in her time and
enjoyed a long stage history: <i>The Busie Body</i> (1709); <i>The
Wonder: A Woman Keeps a Secret</i> (1714); and <i>A Bold Stroke for a
Wife</i> (1717). <i>The Busie Body</i> best illustrates Mrs. Centlivre's
preference for laughing comedy with an improved moral tone. The
characters and the plot are amusing but inoffensive, and, compared to
those of Restoration drama, satisfy the desire of the growing
eighteenth-century middle-class audience for respectability on the
stage.</p>

<p class = "intro">
The theory of comedy on which <i>The Busie Body</i> rests is a
traditional one, but Mrs. Centlivre's simple pronouncements on the
virtues of realistic over sentimental comedy are interesting because of
the controversy on this subject among critics and writers at this time.
In the preface to her first play, <i>The Perjur'd Husband</i> (1700),
she takes issue with Jeremy Collier on the charge of immorality in
realistic plays. The stage, she believes, should present characters as
they are; <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads 'is it'">it
is</ins> unreasonable to expect a "Person, whose inclinations are always
forming Projects to the Dishonor of her Husband, should deliver her
Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Psalm." In a letter written
in 1700 she says: "I think the main design of Comedy is to make us
laugh." (Abel Boyer, <i>Letters of Wit, Politicks, and Morality</i>,
London, 1701, p. 362). But, she adds, since Collier has taught religion
to the "Rhiming Trade, the Comick Muse in
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
Tragick Posture sat" until she discovered Farquhar, whose language is
amusing but decorous and whose plots are virtuous. This insistence on
decorum and virtue indicates a concession to Collier and to the public.
Thus in the preface to <i>Love's Contrivance</i> (1703), she reiterates
her belief that comedy should amuse but adds that she strove for a
"modest stile" which might not "disoblige the nicest ear." This modest
style, not practiced in early plays, is achieved admirably in <i>The
Busie Body</i>. Yet, as she says in the epilogue, she has not followed
the critics who balk the pleasure of the audience to refine their taste;
her play will with "good humour, pleasure crown the Night." In dialogue,
in plot, and particularly in the character of the amusing but
inoffensive Marplot, she fulfills her simple theory of comedy designed
not for reform but for laughter.</p>

<p class = "intro">
Mrs. Centlivre followed the practices of her contemporaries in borrowing
the plot for <i>The Busie Body</i>. The three sources for the play are:
<i>The Devil Is an Ass</i> (1616) by Jonson; <i>L'Etourdi</i> (1658) by
Molière; and <i>Sir Martin Mar-all or The Feigned Innocence</i> (1667)
by Dryden. From <i>The Devil Is an Ass</i>, Mrs. Centlivre borrowed
minor details and two episodes, one of them the amusing dumb scene. This
scene, though a close imitation, seems more amusing in <i>The Busie
Body</i> than in Jonson's play, perhaps because the characters,
especially Sir Francis Gripe and Miranda, are more credible and more
fully portrayed. From the second source for <i>The Busie Body</i>,
Molière's <i>L'Etourdi</i>, I believe Mrs. Centlivre borrowed the
framework for her parallel plots, the theme of Marplot's blundering, and
the name and general character of Marplot. But she has improved what she
borrowed. She places in Molière's framework more credible women
characters than his, especially in the charming Miranda and the crafty
Patch; she constructs a more skillful intrigue plot for the stage than
his subplot and emphasizes Spanish customs in the lively
Charles-Isabinda-Traffick plot. Mrs. Centlivre concentrates on Marplot's
blundering, whereas Molière concentrates on the servant Mascarille's
schemes. Marplot's funniest blunder, in the "monkey" scene, is entirely
original as far as I know (IV, iv). But her greatest change is in the
character of Marplot, who in
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
her hands becomes not so much stupid as human and irresistibly
ludicrous. Mrs. Centlivre's style is of course inferior to that of
Molière. In the preface to <i>Love's Contrivance</i> (1703), in speaking
of borrowings from Molière, she said that borrowers "must take care to
touch the Colors with an English Pencil, and form the Piece according to
our Manners." Of course her touching the "Colors with an English Pencil"
meant changing the style of Molière to suit the less delicate taste of
the middle-class English audience.</p>

<p class = "intro">
A third source for <i>The Busie Body</i> is Dryden's <i>Sir Martin
Mar-all</i> (1667). Since Dryden followed Molière with considerable
exactness, it would be difficult to prove beyond doubt that Mrs.
Centlivre borrowed from Molière rather than from Dryden. Yet I believe,
after a careful analysis of the plays, that she borrowed from Molière.
She made of <i>The Busie Body</i> a comedy of intrigue based on the
theme and plot used by both Molière and Dryden, but she omitted the
scandalous Restoration third plot which Dryden had added to Molière. Her
characters are English in speech and action, but they lack the
coarseness apparent in Dryden's <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i>. Though it is
impossible to prove the exact sources of Mrs. Centlivre's borrowings,
there is no doubt that she has improved what she borrowed.</p>

<p class = "intro">
Whatever the truth may be about Mrs. Centlivre's use of her sources, her
play remained in the repertory of acting plays long after
<i>L'Etourdi</i> and <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i> had disappeared. <i>The
Busie Body</i> opened at the Drury Lane Theater on May 12, 1709. Steele,
who listed the play in <i>The Tatler</i> for May 14, 1709, does not
mention the length of the run. Thomas Whincop says that the play ran
thirteen nights (<i>Scanderbeg</i>, London, 1747, p. 190), but Genest
says the play had an opening run of seven nights (<i>Some Account of the
English Stage from the Restoration in 1660 to 1830</i>, II, 419). The
play remained popular throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. Genest lists it as being presented in twenty-three seasons
from 1709 to 1800. It was certainly presented much more frequently than
this record shows, for Dougald MacMillan in <i>The Drury Lane
Calendar</i> lists fifty-three
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
performances from 1747-1776, whereas Genest records two performances in
this period. The greatest number of performances in any season was
fourteen in 1758-59, the year David Garrick appeared in the play. From
the records available <i>The Busie Body</i> seems to have reached its
greatest popularity in England in the middle and late eighteenth century
and the early part of the nineteenth century. William Hazlitt, in the
"Prefatory Remarks" to the Oxberry acting edition of 1819, says <i>The
Busie Body</i> has been acted a "thousand times in town and country,
giving delight to the old, the young, and the middle-aged."</p>

<p class = "intro">
<i>The Busie Body</i> enjoyed a similar place of importance in the stage
history of America but achieved its greatest popularity, in New York at
least, in the nineteenth century. First performed in Williamsburg on
September 10, 1736, the play was presented fifteen times in New York in
the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century forty-five
performances were given in New York in sixteen seasons from 1803 to 1885
(George Odell, <i>Annals of the New York Stage</i>). <i>The Busie
Body</i> is frequently cited with <i>The Rivals</i> and <i>The School
for Scandal</i> for opening seasons and for long runs by great
actors.</p>

at this Critical Juncture, over-rules the Fate of all <i>Europe</i>. But
then I was encourag'd by Reflecting, that <i>Lelius</i> and

their important Affairs, thought the Perusal and Improving of

<p>
<i>Cha.</i><br>
<span class = "firstletter">H</span>A!
Sir <i>George Airy!</i> A Birding thus early, what forbidden Game rouz'd
you so soon? For no lawful Occasion cou'd invite a Person of your Figure
abroad at such unfashionable Hours.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> There are some Men, <i>Charles</i>, whom Fortune has
left free from Inquietudes, who are diligently Studious to find out Ways
and Means to make themselves uneasie.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Is it possible that any thing in Nature can ruffle the
Temper of a Man, whom the four Seasons of the Year compliment with as
many Thousand Pounds, nay! and a Father at Rest with his Ancestors.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Why there 'tis now! a Man that wants Money thinks
none can be unhappy that has it; but my Affairs are in such a whimsical
Posture, that it will require a Calculation of my Nativity to find if my
Gold will relieve me or not.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Ha, ha, ha, never consult the Stars about that; Gold has
a Power beyond them; Gold unlocks the Midnight Councils; Gold out-does
the Wind, becalms the Ship, or fills her Sails; Gold is omnipotent
below; it makes whole Armies fight, or fly; It buys even Souls, and
bribes the Wretches to
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
betray their Country: Then what can thy Business be, that Gold won't
serve thee in?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Why, I'm in Love.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> In Love&mdash; Ha, ha, ha, ha; In Love, Ha, ha, ha, with
what, prithee, a <i>Cherubin!</i></p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> No, with a Woman.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> A Woman, Good, Ha, ha, ha, and Gold not help thee?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> But suppose I'm in Love with two&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Ay, if thou'rt in Love with two hundred, Gold will fetch
'em, I warrant thee, Boy. But who are they? who are they? come.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> One is a Lady, whose Face I never saw, but Witty as
an Angel; the other Beautiful as <i>Venus</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> And a Fool&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> For ought I know, for I never spoke to her, but you
can inform me; I am charm'd by the Wit of One, and dye for the Beauty of
the Other?</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> And pray, which are you in Quest of now?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> I prefer the Sensual Pleasure, I'm for her I've seen,
who is thy Father's Ward <i>Miranda</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Nay then, I pity you; for the Jew my Father will no more
part with her, and 30000 Pound, than he wou'd with a Guinea to keep me
from starving.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Now you see Gold can't do every thing,
<i>Charles</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Yes, for 'tis her Gold that bars my Father's Gate against
you.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Why, if he is this avaricious Wretch, how cam'st thou
by such a Liberal Education?</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Not a Souse out of his Pocket, I assure you; I had an
Uncle who defray'd that Charge, but for some litte Wildnesses of Youth,
tho' he made me his Heir, left Dad my Guardian till I came to Years of
Discretion, which I presume the old Gentleman will never think I am; and
now he has got the Estate into his Clutches, it does me no more good,
than if it lay in <i>Prester John</i>'s Dominions.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> What can'st thou find no Stratagem to redeem it?</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
<i>Cha.</i> I have made many Essays to no purpose; tho' Want, the
Mistress of Invention, still tempts me on, yet still the old Fox is too
cunning for me&mdash; I am upon my last Project, which if it fails, then
for my last Refuge, a Brown Musquet.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> What is't, can I assist thee?</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Not yet, when you can, I have Confidence enough in you to
ask it.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> I am always ready, but what do's he intend to do with
<i>Miranda?</i> Is she to be sold in private? or will he put her up by
way of Auction, at who bids most? If so, Egad, I'm for him: my Gold, as
you say, shall be subservient to my Pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> To deal ingeniously with you, Sir <i>George</i>, I know
very little of Her, or Home; for since my Uncle's Death, and my Return
from Travel, I have never been well with my Father; he thinks my
Expences too great, and I his Allowance too little; he never sees me,
but he quarrels; and to avoid that, I shun his House as much as
possible. The Report is, he intends to marry her himself.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Can she consent to it?</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Yes faith, so they say; but I tell you, I am wholly
ignorant of the matter. <i>Miranda</i> and I are like two violent
Members of a contrary Party, I can scarce allow her Beauty, tho' all the
World do's; nor she me Civility, for that Contempt, I fancy she plays
the Mother-in-law already, and sets the old Gentleman on to do
mischief.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Then I've your free Consent to get her.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Ay and my helping-hand, if occasion be.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Pugh, yonder's a Fool coming this way, let's avoid
him.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> What <i>Marplot</i>, no no, he's my Instrument; there's a
thousand Conveniences in him, he'll lend me his Money when he has any,
run of my Errands and be proud on't; in short, he'll Pimp for me, Lye
for me, Drink for me, do any thing but Fight for me, and that I trust to
my own Arm for.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Nay then he's to be endur'd; I never knew his
Qualifications before.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<div class = "entrance">Enter <span class = "charname">Marplot</span>
with a Patch cross his Face.</div>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Dear <i>Charles</i>, your's,&mdash; Ha! Sir <i>George
Airy</i>, the Man in the World, I have an Ambition to be known to
<span class = "insetdir">(aside.)</span> Give me thy Hand, dear
Boy&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> A good Assurance! But heark ye, how came your Beautiful
Countenance clouded in the wrong place?</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> I must confess 'tis a little <i>Mal-a-propos</i>, but
no matter for that; a Word with you, <i>Charles</i>; Prithee, introduce
me to Sir <i>George</i>&mdash; he is a Man of Wit, and I'd give ten
Guinea's to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> When you have 'em, you mean.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Ay, when I have 'em; pugh, pox, you cut the Thread of
my Discourse&mdash; I wou'd give ten Guinea's, I say, to be rank'd in his
Acquaintance: Well, 'tis a vast Addition to a Man's Fortune, according
to the Rout of the World, to be seen in the Company of Leading Men; for
then we are all thought to be Politicians, or Whigs, or Jacks, or
High-Flyers, or Low-Flyers, or Levellers&mdash;and so forth; for you
must know, we all herd in Parties now.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Then a Fool for Diversion is out of Fashion, I find.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Yes, without it be a mimicking Fool, and they are
Darlings every where; but prithee introduce me.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Well, on Condition you'll give us a true Account how you
came by that Mourning Nose, I will.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> I'll do it.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Sir <i>George</i>, here's a Gentleman has a passionate
Desire to kiss your Hand.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Oh, I honour Men of the Sword, and I presume this
Gentleman is lately come from <i>Spain</i> or <i>Portugal</i>&mdash;by
his Scars.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> No really, Sir <i>George</i>, mine sprung from civil
Fury, happening last Night into the Groom-Porters&mdash;I had a strong
Inclination to go ten Guineas with a sort of a, sort of a&mdash;kind of
a Milk Sop, as I thought: A Pox of the Dice he flung out, and my Pockets
being empty as <i>Charles</i>
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
knows they sometimes are, he prov'd a surly <i>North-Britain</i>, and
broke my Face for my Deficiency.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha! ha! and did not you draw?</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Draw, Sir, why, I did but lay my Hand upon my Sword to
make a swift Retreat, and he roar'd out. Now the Deel a Ma sol, Sir, gin
ye touch yer Steel, Ise whip mine through yer Wem.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha, ha, ha,</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Ha, ha, ha, ha, fase was the Word, so you walk'd off, I
suppose.</p>

<p><i>Marp.</i> Yes, for I avoid fighting, purely to be serviceable to
my Friends you know&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Your Friends are much oblig'd to you, Sir, I hope
you'll rank me in that Number.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Sir <i>George</i>, a Bow from the side Box, or to be
seen in your Chariot, binds me ever yours.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Trifles, you may command 'em when you please.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Provided he may command you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Me! why I live for no other purpose&mdash; Sir
<i>George</i>, I have the Honour to be carest by most of the reigning
Toasts of the Town, I'll tell 'em you are the finest
Gentleman&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> No, no, prithee let me alone to tell the
Ladies&mdash;my Parts&mdash;can you convey a Letter upon Occasion, or
deliver a Message with an Air of Business, Ha!</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> With the Assurance of a Page and the Gravity of a
Statesman.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> You know <i>Miranda!</i></p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> What, my Sister <i>Ward?</i> Why, her Guardian is mine,
we are Fellow Sufferers: Ah! he is a covetous, cheating, sanctify'd
Curmudgeon; that Sir <i>Francis Gripe</i> is a damn'd old&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I suppose, Friend, you forget that he is my
Father&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> I ask your Pardon, <i>Charles</i>, but it is for your
sake I hate him. Well, I say, the World is mistaken in him, his Out-side
Piety, makes him every Man's Executor, and his Inside Cunning, makes him
every Heir's Jaylor. Egad, <i>Charles</i>, I'm half persuaded that
thou'rt some <i>Ward</i> too, and never of
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
his getting: For thou art as honest a Debauchee as ever Cuckolded Man of
Quality.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> A pleasant Fellow.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> The Dog is Diverting sometimes, or there wou'd be no
enduring his Impertinence: He is pressing to be employ'd and willing to
execute, but some ill Fate generally attends all he undertakes, and he
oftner spoils an Intreague than helps it&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> If I miscarry 'tis none of my Fault, I follow my
Instructions.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Yes, witness the Merchant's Wife.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Pish, Pox, that was an Accident.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> What was it, prithee?</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> Why, you must know, I had lent a certain Merchant my
hunting Horses, and was to have met his Wife in his Absence: Sending him
along with my Groom to make the Complement, and to deliver a Letter to
the Lady at the same time; what does he do, but gives the Husband the
Letter, and offers her the Horses.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> I remember you was even with me, for you deny'd the
Letter to be yours, and swore I had a design upon her, which my Bones
paid for.</p>

<p><i>Cha.</i> Come, Sir <i>George</i>, let's walk round, if you are not
ingag'd, for I have sent my Man upon a little earnest Business, and have
order'd him to bring me the Answer into the Park.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Business, and I not know it, Egad I'll watch him.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> I must beg your Pardon, <i>Charles</i>, I am to meet
your Father here.</p>

<p><i>Ch.</i> My Father!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Aye! and about the oddest Bargain perhaps you ever
heard off; but I'll not impart till I know the Success.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> What can his Business be with Sir <i>Francis?</i> Now
wou'd I give all the World to know it; why the Devil should not one know
every Man's Concern.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Ha! Mis <i>Patch</i> alone, did not you tell me you had contriv'd a
way to bring <i>Isabinda</i> to the Park?</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> Oh, Madam, your Ladiship can't imagine what a wretched
Disappointment we have met with: Just as I had fetch'd a Suit of my
Cloaths for a Disguise: comes my old Master into his Closet, which is
right against her Chamber Door; this struck us into a terrible
Fright&mdash; At length I put on a Grave Face, and ask'd him if he was at
leisure for his Chocolate, in hopes to draw him out of his Hole; but he
snap'd my Nose off, No, I shall be busie here this two Hours; at which
my poor Mistress seeing no way of Escape, order'd me to wait on your
Ladiship with the sad Relation.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> Unhappy <i>Isabinda!</i> Was ever any thing so
unaccountable as the Humour of Sir <i><ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original">Jealousie</ins> Traffick</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<i>Patch.</i> Oh, Madam, it's his living so long in <i>Spain</i>, he
vows he'll spend half his Estate, but he'll be a Parliament-Man, on
purpose to bring in a Bill for Women to wear Veils, and the other odious
<i>Spanish</i> Customs&mdash; He swears it is the height of Impudence to
have a Woman seen Bare-fac'd even at Church, and scarce believes there's
a true begotten Child in the City.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> Ha, ha, ha, how the old Fool torments himself! Suppose
he could introduce his rigid Rules&mdash;does he think we cou'd not
match them in Contrivance? No, no; Let the Tyrant Man make what Laws he
will, if there's a Woman under the Government, I warrant she finds a way
to break 'em: Is his Mind set upon the <i>Spaniard</i> for his
Son-in-law still?</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> Ay, and he expects him by the next Fleet, which drives
his Daughter to Melancholy and Despair: But, Madam, I find you retain
the same gay, cheerful Spirit you had, when I waited on your
Ladiship.&mdash; My Lady is mighty good-humour'd too, and I have found a
way to make Sir <ins class = "correction" title =
"so in original"><i>Jealousie</i></ins> believe I am wholly in his
Interest, when my real Design is to serve her; he makes me her Jaylor,
and I set her at Liberty.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> I know thy Prolifick Brain wou'd be of singular Service
to her, or I had not parted with thee to her Father.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> But, Madam, the Report is that you are going to marry
your Guardian.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> It is necessary such a Report shou'd be,
<i>Patch</i>.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> But is it true, Madam?</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> That's not absolutely necessary.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> I thought it was only the old Strain, coaxing him still
for your own, and railing at all the young Fellows about Town; in my
Mind now, you are as ill plagu'd with your Guardian, Madam, as my Lady
is with her Father.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> No, I have Liberty, Wench, that she wants; what would
she give now to be in this <i>dissabilee</i> in the&mdash;open Air, nay
more, in pursuit of the young Fellow she likes; for that's my Case, I
assure thee.</p>

she can't come abroad, we have a way to bring him home in spight of old

<p>Sir <i>Fran.</i> Well, well, I don't desire to hear what you say, Ha,

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> A very extraordinary Bargain I have made truly, if

morally impossible&mdash;but then what hopes have I to succeed, I never

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> What tho' my Tongue never spoke, my Eyes said a

Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha! my <i>Incognito</i>&mdash;upon a Woman, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> They are the worst Things you can deal in, and damage
the soonest; your very Breath destroys 'em, and I fear you'll never see
your Return, Sir <i>George</i>, Ha, ha!</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Were they more brittle than <i>China</i>, and drop'd
to pieces with a Touch, every Atom of her I have ventur'd at, if she is
but Mistress of thy Wit, ballances Ten times the Sum&mdash; Prithee let
me see thy Face.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> By no means, that may spoil your Opinion of my
Sense&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Rather confirm it, Madam.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> So rob the Lady of your Gallantry, Sir.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> No Child, a Dish of Chocolate in the Morning never
spoils my Dinner; the other Lady, I design a set Meal; so there's no
danger&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> Matrimony! Ha, ha, ha; what Crimes have you committed
against the God of Love, that he should revenge 'em so severely to stamp
Husband upon your Forehead&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> For my Folly in having so often met you here, without
pursuing the Laws of Nature, and exercising her command&mdash; But I
resolve e'er we part now, to know who you are, where you live, and what
kind of Flesh and Blood your Face is; therefore unmask and don't put me
to the trouble of doing it for you.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> My Face is the same Flesh and Blood with my Hand, Sir
<i>George</i>, which if you'll be so rude to provoke.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> You'll apply it to my Cheek&mdash; The Ladies Favours
are always Welcome; but I must have that Cloud withdrawn. <span class =

what a terrible thing would it be to lose this pretty white Hand.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> And how will it sound in a <i>Chocolate-House</i>, that
Sir <i>George Airy</i> rudely pull'd off a Ladies Mask, when he had
given her his Honour, that he never would, directly or indirectly
endeavour to know her till she gave him Leave.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> I wish we were safe out.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> But if that Lady thinks fit to pursue and meet me at
every turn like some troubl'd Spirit, shall I be blam'd

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Oh! I'll return the Obligation in a Moment.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> And marry her?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha, ha, ha, that's not the way to Love her Child.</p>

look upon me I shall sink, even mask'd as I am) I will confess why I
have engag'd you so often, who I am, and where I live?</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Well, to show you I'm a Man of Honour I accept the
Conditions. Let me but once know those, and the Face won't be long a
Secret to me.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> That, and a close Room, wou'd certainly make me die of

no receiving Visits at home; for in our loose Country, the Women are as

<p><i>Patch.</i> So I told her, Sir; and that it was not Decent to be

me, I was her Servant, not her Governess.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Did she so? But I'll make her to know, that you are

'tis not the Restraint, but the Innate Principles, secures the

Confinement
sharpens the Invention, as want of Sight strengthens the other Senses,

allows.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Say you so, Mistress, who the Devil taught you the

pretend to, that can think any Woman innocent who requires Liberty.
Therefore, <i>Patch</i>, to your Charge I give her; Lock her up till I

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha! the Voice of my <i>Incognita</i>&mdash; Why did
you take Ten Thousand ways to captivate a Heart your Eyes alone had
vanquish'd?</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> Prithee, no more of these Flights; for our Time's but

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> 'Tis his known Character.</p>

he sends me word he goes this Minute; it must be to Morrow e'er he can

you wou'd be a Friend to poor <i>Charles</i>, tho' the Son of this

Education can make him; and what now I have vanity enough to hope will
induce you, he is the Man on Earth I love.</p>

<p><i>Miran.</i> I never was his Enemy, and only put it on as it help'd

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> I am glad on't, for I find I have lost much of my

Don Pedro</i>, &amp;c. his worthy Father.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> To see an Affair of Marriage Consummated between a
Daughter of yours, and <i>Seignor Diego Babinetto</i> his Son here.
True, Sir, such a Trust is repos'd in me as that Letter will inform you.
I hope 'twill pass upon him. <span class =

<p><i>Char.</i> If the whole Plot succeeds as well, I'm happy.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Sir I find by this, that you are a Man of Honour and

<p>Sir <i>Geo. Meanwell</i> is my Name, Sir.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> A very good Name, and very Significant.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Yes, Faith if he knew all.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> For to Mean-well is to be honest, and to be honest

<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Therefore, Sir, I must intreat the Presence of your
fair Daughter, and the Assistance of your Chaplain; for <i>Seignor Don
Pedro</i> strictly enjoyn'd me to see the Marriage Rites perform'd as
soon as we should arrive, to avoid the Accidental Overtures of
<i>Venus</i>.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Overtures of <i>Venus!</i></p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ay, Sir, that is, those little Hawking Females that
traverse the Park, and the Play-house to put off their damag'd
Ware&mdash;they fasten upon Foreigners like Leeches, and watch their
Arrival as carefully, as the <i>Kentish</i> Men do a Ship-wreck. I
warrant you they have heard of him already.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Nay, I know this Town swarms with them.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ay, and then you know the <i>Spaniards</i> are
naturally Amorous, but very Constant, the first Face fixes 'em, and it
may be dangerous to let him ramble e'er he is tied.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Well hinted.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Pat to my Purpose&mdash; Well, Sir, there is but one

<p><i>Char.</i> Pray Heaven, that one thing more don't spoil all.</p>
<div class = "stagedir">(Aside.</div>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal. Don Pedro</i> writ me Word in his last but one,
that he design'd the Sum of Five Thousand Crowns by way of Joynture for
my Daughter; and that it shou'd be paid into my Hand upon the Day of

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Humph! True, Sir <i>Jealous</i>, he told me such a

that you would insist upon the very Day, for, for, for, for Money you

well it's no worse, since 'tis no better. Come, young Man, seeing thou
hast out-witted me, take her, and Bless you both.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> I hope, Sir, you'll bestow your Blessing too, 'tis all
I'll ask.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Ha, ha, ne'er mind his Curses, <i>Charles</i>;
thou'lt thrive not one jot the worse for 'em. Since this Gentleman is
reconcil'd, we are all made happy.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> I always lov'd Precaution, and took care to avoid
Dangers. But when a thing was past, I ever had Philosophy to be
easie.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Which is the true sign of a great Soul: I lov'd your
Daughter, and she me, and you shall have no reason to repent her
Choice.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> You will not blame me, Sir, for loving my own Country
best.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> So here's every Body happy, I find, but poor
<i>Pilgarlick</i>. I wonder what Satisfaction I shall have, for being
cuff'd, kick'd, and beaten in your Service.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> I have been a little too familiar with you, as
things are fallen out; but since there's no help for't, you must forgive
me.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> Egad I think so&mdash; But provided that you be not so
familiar for the future.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> Thou hast been an unlucky Rogue.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> But very honest.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> That I'll vouch for; and freely forgive thee.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Geo.</i> And I'll do you one piece of Service more,
<i>Marplot</i>, I'll take care that Sir <i>Francis</i> make you Master
of your Estate.</p>

<p><i>Marpl.</i> That will make me as happy as any of you.</p>

<p><i>Patch.</i> Your humble Servant begs leave to remind you,
Madam.</p>

<p><i>Isab.</i> Sir, I hope you'll give me leave to take <i>Patch</i>
into favour again.</p>

Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Nay, let your Husband look to that, I have done with my
Care.</p>

<p><i>Char.</i> Her own Liberty shall always oblige me. Here's no Body
but honest <i>Whisper</i> and Mrs. <i>Scentwell</i> to be provided for
now. It shall be left to their Choice to Marry, or keep their
Services.</p>

<p><i>Whisp.</i> Nay then, I'll stick to my Master.</p>

<p><i>Scentw.</i> Coxcomb! and I prefer my Lady before a Footman.</p>

<p>Sir <i>Jeal.</i> Hark, I hear Musick, the Fidlers smell a Wedding.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
